Accept the Assignment in repl.it
2 . You should see the files set up
3. Type your code
4. When completed with the entire lab press the fork on the left and it will push back up to GitHub.


Problem_1

 Write a program that displays the result of:
15.4 x 6.5 - 4.3 x 3
____________________
46.3 - 3.5


Problem_2
Hint: You will import the Scanner Class
Write a program that takes in user input to ask the following questions:
“What is your favorite food?”
“What is your favorite color?”
“What is your favorite movie?”
After asking these three questions, print out the answers on their own lines.
An example output would look like this:
pasta
green
The Lego Movie

Problem_3
Hint: Remember how a boolean is created as a variable?
Declare a String, int, double and a boolean variable. The variable values should be your name, lucky number, the current temperature and if you are a student.  Print the outcome of the variables. Each output should run on a separate line.

Problem_4
You will write a program that serves as a simple calculator. Your program will ask the user for three ints.  Two of the ints should be either added or subtracted.  The third int should be multiplied by the result of the addition or subtraction.  The result should be printed in one print statement.

Problem_5
A grocery store sells apples for $1.00 each, bananas for $2.00 each, grapes for $3.00 each bunch, and peaches for $5.00 each. 
Ask the shopper/user how much of each fruit they want and calculate the user’s total cost.
Bonus Points: Look up how to format with a dollar sign and two decimal places.
Example of output:
My grocery store: 
How many apples? 
3
How many Bananas? 
2
How many grapes? 
4
How many peaches? 
1
Apple total 3.0
Banana total 4.0
Grapes total 12.0
Peaches total 5.0
